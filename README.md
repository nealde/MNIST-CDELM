# MNIST-CDELM
This is a repository of my recreation of an MNIST Convolutional Deep ELM.  I am working to imitate some of the tables made in [this](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2016/3049632/) work.

[Keras](https://keras.io/) will be used with the tensorflow backend, training on a GTX 1080.  I'll be aiming to document the process and hopefully examine error vs epochs for ELMs, DNNs, and cDNNs.
